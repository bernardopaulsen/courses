            \item Design
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Architecture
                \item High level
                \item Models
                \item Coupling
                \item Cohesion
                \item Low level
                \item Modularity
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Software Architecture Introduction}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Architecture is the very top level of design.
            \item Architects are the link between idea and reality.
            \item Architecture is something that cannot be fixed once implemented.
            \item In software, bad architecture is something that can't be fixed with good programming.
        \end{itemize}
